## Configuration
For heading estimation the two antennas need to be on the same level and at least 30 cm apart from each other. The direction that they are facing does not matter as it can be configured with the GPS_YAW_OFFSET parameter.

Configure the serial port on which the [MINI2 Receiver](http://www.femtomes.com)  will run using GPS_1_CONFIG, and set the baud rate to 115200 using SER_GPS1_BAUD.
